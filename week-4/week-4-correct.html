<h3> Paige's 3rd heading. </h3>

My color and typography choices reflect my personal identity a lot. The colors are bright yet slightly muted. I would say I am a social bright person, but I definitely have a more chill demeanor. There is a muted pink, green, and three shades of blue. The pink and green are my creative and fun side, whereas the blues are my demeanor. The typography also reflects two sides of myself. One of the fonts is a bit more corporate and structured while the other is very whimsical and artsy. I love to act like I am purely a freespirited, artistic person, but in reality I love having structure, routine, and a plan. These two sides of myself balance each other. I am a person who is organized and on top of things, yet has a strong appreciation for the unexpected moments in life that bring more creative inspiration. 
Accessibility requirements affect my design choices to make sure I am using semantic HTML instead of regular HTML. I want to make sure the computer can understand the structures of my content by making sure it is outlined in that way. 
It can be challenging when finding the balance between accessibility and personal expression because you may love the look of a design, but understand that it will not work well with accessibility tools such as text to audio. It is important to find a way to create a webpage that resonates with people who use their vision as their main sense, while also resonating with those who don’t. It can actually help us to be more creative with our website design to think through more unique layouts.

<p> It surprised me how difficult it can be to create shapes and how easy it is to make colors change when hovering. I would have expected it to be the opposite. This makes me appreciate websites with lots of complex shapes. 
I will apply this system a lot in my portfolio. It will be helpful to understand how to change colors and features on text to create a webpage that is super easy to understand and find important information. 
I would expand this into being multiple pages but using the design skills I learned today to make it a super cohesive and easy to understand main page. I want it to be simple to find everything you need, especially if I am targeting recruiters with my page. 
Shapes don’t feel super flexible to me. I know we learned a bit about the structure of pages, but right now I am still curious how you would overlay multiple shapes under text. It sounds difficult to make it easily comprehensive.
