<p>Hi, I am Paige</p>
<body>
    <p>Iâ€™m drawn to the stories behind what people 
        choose, what they buy, what they believe, 
        and what makes them feel seen. This curiosity 
        may explain my habit of always asking people 
        which character they resonate with most, and 
        why I took more anthropology electives than 
        my degree ever required. Understanding the 
        world someone moves through, and what truly
        resonates with them, is what drives my approach
         to strategy in marketing.</p>
