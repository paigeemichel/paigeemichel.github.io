    <h2>About Header </h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m drawn to the stories behind what people choose, 
        what they buy, what they believe, and what makes 
        them feel seen. 
        
        This curiosity may explain my habit of always asking
         people which character they resonate with most, and 
         why I took more anthropology electives than my degree
        ever required. Understanding the world someone moves 
        through, and what truly resonates with them, is what 
        drives my approach to strategy in marketing.</p>
