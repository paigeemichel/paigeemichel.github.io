    <h3> Paige Michel</h4>
<p>
Iâ€™m drawn to the stories behind what people choose, what they buy, what they believe, and what makes them feel seen. This curiosity may explain my habit of always asking people which character they resonate with most, and why I took more anthropology electives than my degree ever required. Understanding the world someone moves through, and what truly resonates with them, is what drives my approach to strategy in marketing.
