<h2> I am Paige!</h2>
<h3> People-First Advertising </h3>
<h4> Strategy & Account Management</h4>



<p>
My creative journey started early with a rotating list of dream jobs 
(fine artist, interior designer, photographer, even engineer, briefly) 
and a blog I launched at age 10, long before Carrie Bradshaw made her 
way onto my Pinterest boards. Before I knew what a brand strategist was,
 I was already exploring ideas, building things, and looking for meaning 
 in the everyday.
</p>



<p> 
    I’m drawn to the stories behind what people choose, what they believe,
     and what makes them feel seen. That curiosity may explain my habit of 
     always asking people which movie or TV character they resonate with 
     most, and why I took more anthropology electives than my degree ever 
     required.
</p>



<p>
    The pull toward human behavior and creative expression eventually led me 
    to marketing, where I found the perfect blend of creativity, connection, 
    and human truth. Understanding the world someone moves through, and what 
    truly resonates with them, is what drives my approach to strategy. I’m 
    drawn to work that is grounded in empathy and guided by insight, work 
    that meets people where they are.
